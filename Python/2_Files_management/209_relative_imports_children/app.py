from util.common.second_import.py import funct2
#from util.first_import.py import func1

print ('We executed main app.py')
print(__name__)

# the name printed is __main_-as this is the way pythin sees this main app that was first run.
# the same print in second_import.py script will print he path of that py file.

# !!1 i do not manage to use first_import.py
# probably because of the folder hierarchy i use !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
