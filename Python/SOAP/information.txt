- the 'data' is the ROOT
- it has dictionaries inside each with the Tag 'country'
- the Tag 'country' has 1 atribute called 'name'. A Tag can have more than 1 atributes.
- The Tag 'country' has several children each with its Tag and value.
- In a Tag you can have just a text like for Tag "rank", "year", "gdppc". Or some atributes of a mixt of atributes and a text.
- The first child of ROOT, the TAG "country", has a child with Tag "neighbor" where there are 2 atributes and a Text.

Parsing:
1. it can be done with ElementTree library like in exemple02.
https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html
It even has a way to use Xpath to fetch the elements inside xml.
2. it can be done with BeautifulSoup library like in exemple03.
The ElementTree way looks simpler.
